# Piwik-iPhone

An open-source iPhone styled web-app for [Piwik](http://piwik.org/).

***

## Usage

Installation is fairly straight forward. You can copy it via FTP and access it via `http://yourdomain.tld/path/to/folder`. You will have to create at least one other user besides the admin user in your Piwik installation before you can use it. The easiest method is to create a user called *view* and give it view permissions to all your sites. Then copy the API key in.

## TODO

Considering I'm forking this project I'd like to add at least saving the access token (**for view access only!**) due to the hinderance of having to enter it *every single time* you want to open it up.

Another possibility would be to compile a native application.
